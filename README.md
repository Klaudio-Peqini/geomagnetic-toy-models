# Geomagnetic Toy Models

**Low-dimensional, conceptual, and stochastic models of the geomagnetic field**

---

## Overview

This repository collects a curated set of **reduced, low-dimensional “toy models”** designed to explore the long-term dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field, with particular emphasis on:

- geomagnetic **reversals** and **excursions**
- stochastic transitions and bistability
- dipole dominance and breakdown
- scaling arguments and interpretability
- links between conceptual models and full geodynamo simulations

These models are **not intended to replace full 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations** of the geodynamo (e.g. XSHELLS or similar frameworks). Instead, they serve as **complementary tools** aimed at physical insight, rapid experimentation, pedagogical clarity, and hypothesis testing.

## Motivation

Full geodynamo simulations are computationally expensive and often difficult to interpret at a mechanistic level. Toy models, by contrast, allow one to:

- isolate essential degrees of freedom,
- test conceptual mechanisms for reversals and excursions,
- explore parameter space efficiently,
- connect paleomagnetic observations to dynamical systems theory,
- provide interpretable bridges between theory, data, and simulation.

This repository embraces the philosophy that **understanding often begins with reduction**.

## Scope of the Repository

The models included here span several conceptual families:

- **Domino and coupled-element models**  
  (collective polarity reversals, interaction-driven dynamics)

- **Bistable and double-well systems**  
  (noise-induced transitions, stochastic resonance)

- **Phase and oscillator-based models**  
  (synchronization, coherence loss, collective modes)

- **Data-informed reduced models**  
  (low-dimensional observables extracted from simulations or paleodata)

Each model family lives in its own subdirectory under `models/`, with local documentation and examples.
